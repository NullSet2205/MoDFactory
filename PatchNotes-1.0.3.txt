New Feature!

You can now import and export ship builds from the hangar!
 - To export, click the export button in the bottom left (it shares functionality with former Part List button).
     - This will bring up a code that you can copy and share with other players. 
 - To import a build, hold Control while clicking any Create New Ship button. 
     - This will bring up a dialog box where you can paste a code to import that ship. 
 - Let's grow that community build knowledge!

Balance Adjustments:
 - The respawn timer is now 20 seconds + 5 seconds per pervious death
     - The respawn timer in vanilla is 10 seconds + 5 seconds per previous death
     - We mentioned that this increase was coming along with the removal of permadeath, as a counter to suicide rush strategies. 

 - Destroying the Main Deck increases respawn times by 30 seconds
     - Destroying Main Deck in vanilla reduced turret fire rate
     - The Main Deck is in a very appealing target for bombing as the only external part on the bow of the carrier. 
       However, Turret fire rate is not an impactful enough penalty to really compete with parts with a similar difficulty in 
       bombing, such as the Radar, let alone the higher value targets like the Repair Bay or the Ammo Depot. We'll see if this 
       new effect fits the bill.

 - Carrier turrets respawn 3 minutes after they are destroyed.
     - Turrets are one of the main advantages held by defenders. The idea here is to make things a bit more awkward for 
       attacking gunships. Notably, every part can be bombed from an angle that avoids the turrets.
     - As a side effect, this also should help to address an oddity where it was sometimes optimal to repeatedly crash 
       into carrier parts. Now, that will likely expose you to turret fire.
     - The 3 minute timer was inspired by the cannon fire rate as that felt like a natural cadence to the game. We can 
       easily adjust this if needed.

 - Reduced the damage destroying a turret deals to the hull to 150 (30% of a turret's health). 
     - Previously, destroying a turret dealt 250 damage to the hull (50% of a turret's health). This meant that the optimal 
       hull bombing strategy with splash weapons was to go around destroying turrets, as that dealt 20% bonus damage to the 
       hull (120% damage = 50% from turret destruction + 70% from splash), in addition to reducing the effectiveness of 
       defenders by removing a damage source. Now, the damage is reduced but the utility remains. Worth mentioning, there are 
       still weapons that deal greater than 70% splash damage, and so those can still be used if you want a build that focuses 
       on turrets. They respawn now too so you will not run out of targets. 

Quality of Life Adjustments:
 - Bots will stay on task!
     - Once you give a command to the bots, they will follow that command until another is given or it becomes invalid.
     - They will still move about some as they feel appropriate (focusing low enemies, refueling at dock, etc.), but they 
       will always return to the ordered task.
     - Essentially, this removes the need to spam commands at the bots. Everything else remains unchanged. 

 - The Carrier Command Improve Turrets revives and repairs all turrets 
     - Previously, only revived the two turrets closest to the player, within 200 units.
     - As part of the benefit of Improve Turrets was moved into turrets automatically respawning, we wanted to give this a slight buff.
     - In practice though, the turrets you want to revive are likely to be the ones near where you are fighting, so the real benefit is minimal.
     - We are going to keep our eyes on this Add On and may give it additional buffs if needed. 

 - Satellite weapons fire from different sources and have better targeting.
     - Barrage can now hit the Repair Bay. Hoorah! 
     - There are a lot of angles attacks could come from, so there still may be room to improve. We'd love feedback. 
     - Barrage still has some bugs held over from vanilla. We are investigating. 

 - More detailed tooltips for shield regen and dash speed in the Hangar. 
     - The time to regen to full and the speed while boosting can both be very important values for a ship's design. 
       Now, they can be viewed automatically in the hangar! 
     - If there are any other quantities that you feel would be good to add to the Hangar, let us know!

 - (Added in 1.0.2) There's now a Patcher Patcher!
 - The Patcher Patcher has been redesigned to avoid false positives with antivirus
     - We will miss you, Auto Hotkey.
