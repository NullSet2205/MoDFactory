∅ and Eiko are excited to announce version 1.0 of **M∅D Factory**, a brand-new Mod for GoD Factory with the goal of making high level GoD Factory gameplay more accessible to new players, along with some bugfixes and balance changes to make the game more enjoyable for everyone! This project has been 7 years in the making, and we're beyond thrilled to finally release version 1.0!

We want to give a huge thanks to everyone at Nine Dots (but especially Gheeyom and Keos), for giving the two of us their blessing to work on and release this project, for giving us advice and pointers when we needed it, and most of all for making this wonderful game that we all love so much!

Read on for the installation instructions and changelog.

To install:
1) Download the mod_install.zip folder found at https://github.com/NullSet2205/MoDFactory/raw/refs/heads/main/mod_install.zip

2) Extract the contents of that zip you just downloaded
 - This contains three files (doorstop_config.ini, .doorstop, version.dll) and a folder (BepinEx).

4) Launch the game!

To temporarily uninstall:
- Rename the BepinEx folder

- Delete the three files and the folder that you copied into the GoD Factory folder.
