Welcome to M∅D Factory! A brand-new Mod for GoD Factory with the goal of making high level GoD Factory gameplay more accessible to new players, along with some bugfixes and balance changes to make the game more enjoyable for everyone. 

Thank you to Amethyst Espeon, Eiko, and ∅ for all of their work to create and maintain this project. Thank you to everyone in the community who has tested, played, and given feedback on how to improve this mod. And a huge thank you to everyone at Nine Dots (but especially Gheeyom and Keos), for giving us their blessing to work on and release this project, for giving us advice and pointers, and most of all for making this wonderful game that we all love so much!

To install:
1) Download the mod_install.zip folder found at https://github.com/NullSet2205/MoDFactory/raw/refs/heads/main/mod_install.zip

    - This is usually found C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GoDFactoryWingmen
    - If you are not sure where exactly that is, you can right click on GoD Factory in Steam and go to Manage -> Browse local files

4) Launch the game!

To temporarily uninstall:
 - Rename the BepinEx folder
